<p>
Do you like making things?  Do you enjoy new technologies?  Old technologies?  Breaking things?  Have some creative projects you are working on?

<p>
We want to encourage you.  

<p>
Help develop skills to build your projects, whether it's programming, robotics, 3D printing or modeling, or web design.

<p>
Garrett Wilkin is a professional software developer.  He is also making Internet-connected opensorce Arduino devices.   He has fancy chickens.   

<p>
Benjamin Schrader is a mechanical engineer.  He is making a 3D printer and hopes to make a robot that will mow his lawn.  He no longer has chickens.  He ate them.

<p>
Garrett organized the Hackathon in Bangor this past June, the Maine Civic Hack Day.  The goal is to show that we can create our own opportunities to work with technology for the benefit of our communities.

<p>
Friends of ours with expertise in areas of programming, game design, graphics, law, farming, network security and other areas are interested in helping.
And folks all around want to see you make positive change for the greater community.

<p>
Where some see problems, we see oportunities.

<p>
We trust you already know how to act responsibly and respectfully, but if you don't, we can work on that, too.
